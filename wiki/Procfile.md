# Documentation of the file web: java $JAVA_OPTS -jar target/dependency/jetty-runner.jar --port $PORT target/*.war

## Introduction

This documentation provides an in-depth explanation of the command used to run a Java web application using Jetty Runner. The command is typically used in deployment scripts to start a web application server.

## Description

The command runs a Java web application using the Jetty Runner, which is a standalone Jetty server for running web applications from a WAR file. This is particularly useful for testing and development purposes where a full application server is not required.

## Structure

The command structure is as follows:
- `web`: The command prefix, indicating it is part of a web-related task.
- `java $JAVA_OPTS -jar target/dependency/jetty-runner.jar --port $PORT target/*.war`: The Java command to run the Jetty Runner with the specified options.

## Dependencies

This command depends on the following:
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
- Jetty Runner JAR file
- A WAR file to be deployed

## Imports

There are no imports in this script as it is a command line execution.

## Variables

The command uses the following environment variables:
- `$JAVA_OPTS`: Additional options to pass to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), such as memory settings or system properties.
- `$PORT`: The port number on which the Jetty server will listen for incoming requests.

## Methods

This is a single command and does not contain methods.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the command in a deployment script:

```sh
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx1024m"
export PORT=8080
web: java $JAVA_OPTS -jar target/dependency/jetty-runner.jar --port $PORT target/myapp.war
```

```

## Notes

- Ensure that the `jetty-runner.jar` file is present in the `target/dependency` directory.
- The `target/*.war` should be replaced with the actual WAR file you intend to deploy.

## Vulnerabilities

- **Environment Variable Injection**: Be cautious with the contents of `$JAVA_OPTS` and `$PORT` as they can be manipulated to include harmful values.
- **Server Port Exposure**: Running the server on a public-facing port without proper security measures can expose the application to potential attacks.

Ensure proper validation and security measures are in place when using this command in a production environment.
